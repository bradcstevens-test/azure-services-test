# Power BI Embedded


This template deploys **Power BI Embedded**. **Power BI Embedded** is a **companion service to Power BI. It allows developers use Power BI capabilities with embedded analytics.**

## Power BI Embedded overview and deployed resources

This solution provides a template for deploying Power BI Embedded. 

### Resource provider

Microsoft.PowerBIDedicated

+ **Resource type**: capacities


## Prerequisites

Azure subscription is the only prerequiste for service deployment; however, published Power BI reports from a configured Power BI Service are needed for integration. Additional, the web application that uses the embed code must be registed in the Azure subscription.

## Deployment steps

Modify the azuredeploy.parameters.json file to include the following for each customer: 
- name
- location
- sku (Allowed values: 
                "A1",
                "A2",
                "A3",
                "A4",
                "A5",
                "A6")
- tags (such as owner)

From a PowerShell window, execute the deploy.ps1 script with the following parameters:

+ ServiceName    -  The name of the Azure service being deployed
+ ResourceGroup  -  The name of the resource group for deployment

```
.\deploy.ps1  <ServiceName> <ResourceGroup>
```

_Example:_

  .\deploy.ps1 msp-sample-vnet msp-sample

  Will deploy the template located at .\msp-sample-vnet\azuredeploy.json into the *msp-sample* resource group.
