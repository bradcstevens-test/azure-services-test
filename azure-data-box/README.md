### Hypothetical Use Case
CDW has worked with the client to setup their solution and is actively managing their environment.
- Customer had 20TB of data to migrate into a new Azure Storage Account within a week and didnâ€™t have the bandwidth to upload over the network.
- This is a one-time migration.

Key Azure services that are part of their solution:  
- Azure Data Box
- Azure Storage Account

Portal/Service Catalog/UI or CLI/Scripting and ARM Templates used  
- Azure Portal
- PowerShell
- ARM Templates

Policy Definitions available/applicable in template form

### Provision Solution
- Create Resource Group with Storage Account using PowerShell and ARM Templates
    - Template files are located in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/cdwlabs/azure-services/tree/master/azure-data-box 
- Use Azure Portal to order a new Azure Data Box
- Schedule ticket to follow-up with customer after DataBox order is received
    - Follow-up must include the following tasks:
        - Assist customer with getting data onto the DataBox device
        - Guide customer through data validation process
        - Provide customer with instructions and guidance to return the device

### Configure Solution
The solution was configued using the following processes
- There are no configurations available for Azure Data Box Disk. Once the order has been placed, there is nothing else that can be configured

### Change/Update
The change/update process is as follows
- Once the disk has been received, the customer will follow instructions listed under ResourceName > General > Quickstart.
- To cancel the order, you can follow the documentation here:
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databox/data-box-portal-admin#cancel-an-order
